# Airgap Server

## Getting started - demo

To run demo, just start run `make demo` from the airgap/v2 folder. You'll need [docker buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for the demo.

This demo is ripped from [dqlite](https://github.com/canonical/go-dqlite#demo). See it for instructions on how to use.
